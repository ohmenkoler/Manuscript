	abstract = {The design of thermoacoustic coolers involves an adequate modeling of the thermoacoustic core's performance, which requires, in particular, a precise knowledge of their thermo-physical properties. Materials such as wire mesh stacks, foams, or compressed fibrous media are hard to describe, and their thermo-physical properties are rarely well enough quantified. Moreover, the classical linear thermoacoustic theory is not sufficient to accurately describe the performance of these materials. This paper deals with the experimental performance characterization of various materials for thermoacoustic heat pumping. A dedicated experimental test-bench has been specially developed, which is composed of two loudspeakers placed at opposite ends of a waveguide containing the porous material and a feedback loop to control the acoustic field in the porous material. Its originality is attributable to the possibility of identifying the optimal acoustic field, specific to each material, that maximizes the temperature difference at the ends of the material. Moreover, a specific protocol is implemented to access and compare the thermoacoustic heat flux through various materials at these optimal acoustic fields. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical results shows a reasonable agreement.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic refrigerators have been developed during the last 15 years, employing quasistanding resonant acoustic waves inside ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavities to transfer heat along a stack region. Because higher eﬃciency can be reached when a signiﬁcant travelling wave component exists in the resonator, speciﬁc resonant thermoacoustic devices have been designed allowing to adjust more or less the ratio of travelling and standing wave components. However, the acoustic pressure ﬁeld and the particle velocity ﬁeld do not appear to be the optimal ones, for the thermal quantities of interest. Thus, it is the aim of the paper to present a new kind of thermoacoustic standing wave-like device which allows to control easily and independently the pressure ﬁeld and the particle velocity ﬁeld, after investigating the optimal acoustic ﬁeld, in the stack region, for the main parameters of interest, i.e. the temperature gradient, the thermoacoustic heat ﬂow and the coeﬃcient of performance.},

	abstract = {The problem is considered of the convection of a fluid through a permeable medium as the result of a vertical temperature-gradient, the medium being in the shape of a flat layer bounded above and below by perfectly conducting media. It appears that the minimum temperature-gradient for which convection can occur is approximately 4π2h2μ/kgρ0α D2, where h2 is the thermal diffusivity, g is the acceleration of gravity, μ is the viscosity, k is the permeability, α is the coefficient of cubical expansion, ρ0 is the density at zero temperature, and D is the thickness of the layer; this exceeds the limiting gradient found by Rayleigh for a simple fluid by a factor of 16D2/27π2kρ0. A numerical computation of this gradient, based upon the data now available, indicates that convection currents should not occur in such a geological formation as the Woodbine sand of East Texas (west of the Mexia Fault zone); in view of the fact, however, that the distribution of {NaCl} in this formation seems to require the existence of convection currents, and in view of the approximations involved in applying the present theory, it seems safe tentatively, to conclude that convection currents do exist in this formation and that the expression given above predicts excessive minimum gradients when applied to such a formation.},

In the literature, correlations describing relations among their morphological characteristics have successfully been established and well discussed. However, collective expressions that categorize stacked wire mesh based on their morphology and thermo-hydraulic expressions required for numerical modeling are less explored in the literature. In the present study, cross relations among the morphological characteristics of stacked wire-mesh were arrived at based on mesh-size, wire diameter and stacking type, which are essential for describing the medium and determining key input parameters required for numerical modeling. Furthermore, correlation for speciﬁc surface area, a vital parameter that plays a major role in interstitial heat transfer, is provided. With the arrived correlations, properties of stacked wire-mesh samples of orderly varied mesh-size and porosity are obtained for various stacking scenarios, and corresponding thermo-hydraulic parameters appearing in the governing equations are evaluated. A vertical channel housing the categorized wire-mesh porous media is numerically modeled to analyze thermal and ﬂow characteristics of such a medium. The proposed correlations can be used in conﬁdence to evaluate thermo-hydraulic parameters appearing in governing equations in order to numerically model various samples of stacked wire-mesh types of porous media in a variety of heat transfer applications.},

	abstract = {A numerical study of the thermoacoustic heat pumping effect inside a stack of parallel solid plates placed in a compact cavity is undertaken, for the purpose of determining how gravity modifies the temperature and flow fields and therefore the performance of the thermoacoustic energy conversion. To address the gravity effects, a configuration with at least two dimensions is required, thus enlarging the one-dimensional models commonly used in the field of thermoacoustics. The numerical model is based on the low Mach-number approximation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with flow rate inlets in order to account for the acoustic sources. The influence of gravity is highlighted and identified as a buoyancy effect driven by horizontal temperature gradients inside the stack and more generally inside the cavity. Gravity effects on thermoacoustic heat pumping are quantified when inclining the device and increasing the input acoustic power. These effects induce a decrease in the coefficient of performance, which is more noticeable when the drive ratio is smaller and when the gravity force is perpendicular to the plates.},

	abstract = {A combined experimental and theoretical investigation was conducted to examine the thermal conductivity of layers of wire mesh screen. Employing a carefully controlled sintering process, layers of sintered wire screen were examined experimentally. The experimental results indicate that the eﬀective thermal conductivity in the z-direction (i.e., normal to the plane of the wire screen layers) for single layer, inline structures and staggered multilayer wire screens is approximately 4–25\% and 6.4–35\% times that of the solid metal thermal conductivity, respectively. In addition to the conductivity of the base material, the contact conditions between the individual wires, as well as between the individual layers were found to be the most important factors in the determination of the eﬀective thermal conductivity. In parallel with the experimental investigation, an analytical model was developed and shown to accurately predict the eﬀective thermal conductivity of these layers as a function of the contact conditions between the wires, between the individual layers, and between the solid heating surface and the ﬁrst layer of screen. In addition to the contact conditions, this new model is strongly dependent on three geometric parameters: the mesh number, M, the wire diameter, d, and the compression factor, cf. Experimental data from this and other investigations were used to verify the accuracy of the model, which was shown to accurately predict the eﬀective conductivity as a function of the above mentioned parameters. In addition, a comprehensive literature review was performed and analyzed in order to further substantiate the validity and accuracy of this new model. The resulting conclusions highlight the importance of the contact conditions between the wires in the individual layers, and between the layers and the solid surface.},

The engine delivers up to 2 {kW} of acoustic power, with an efficiency (the ratio of acoustic power to heater power) of up to 20\%. An understanding of the pressure and volumevelocity waves is very good. The agreement between measured and calculated powers and temperatures is reasonable. Some of the measured thermal power that cannot be accounted for by calculation can be attributed to Rayleigh streaming in the two thermal buffer tubes with the largest aspect ratios. A straightforward extension of this work should yield cascade thermoacoustic engines with efficiencies of around 35–40\% of the Carnot efficiency.},

In this paper, a further detailed investigation into this suppression method are made, including the effect of number and material of screens, input acoustic power, and some other factors on suppressing natural convection at different inclination angles h in the range of 0–180°. In our experiment of a single stage inline type {PTC} driven by a linear compressor, the orientation-dependence is considerably weakened with 6-layer copper screens in the pulse tube, in the cold temperature range of 40–80 K. Moreover, the cooling performance deterioration at h = 0° induced by the inserted screens can be kept in an acceptable range. This novel suppression of natural convection greatly improves adaptability of pulse tube cryocoolers’ application.},

@thesis{duffourd_refrigerateur_2001,
	title = {Réfrigérateur thermoacoustique : études analytiques et expérimentales en vue d'une miniaturisation},
	abstract = {L'effet thermoacoustique est un phénomène qui résulte de l'interaction d'une onde acoustique intense avec une paroi et qui se traduit par un transport de chaleur dans la couche limite thermique parallèlement à la paroi. Dans un réfrigérateur thermoacoustique, ce phénomène est exploité au moyen d'un empilement de plaques, très fines et très finement espacées, appelé "stack" et placé dans un résonateur acoustique. L'effet thermoacoustique permet alors de créer
une différence de température qui peut atteindre plusieurs dizaines de degrés Celsius et qui est mise à profit au moyen d'échangeurs de chaleur. Les recherches dans ce domaine ont commencé
depuis une vingtaine d'années aux Etats-Unis et ont abouti à la réalisation de plusieurs prototypes de grandes dimensions. Néanmoins, lorsqu'il s'agit d'optimiser la conception de tels systèmes, on atteint rapidement les limites des modèles existants. Une compréhension plus fine des phénomènes physiques mis en jeu s'avère donc nécessaire, particulièrement dans l'optique d'une miniaturisation de ce type de systèmes, qui est la finalité de ce travail. 
Nous avons construit un premier banc de mesure de l'effet thermoacoustique qui nous a
permis de faire une étude sur différents empilements de plaques. L'influence des paramètres
géométriques des plaques, de la position de l'empilement dans le résonateur et du niveau de
pression acoustique sur la différence de température créée a été caractérisée et comparée aux prévisions de la théorie linéaire de Atchley et coll. (1990). Grâce à un deuxième système expérimental, nous avons mesuré l'évolution temporelle de la distribution de température le long de l'axe d'un stack thermoacoustique depuis la mise en marche de la source acoustique
j u s q u ' a u régime stationnaire. Ces mesures ont été effectuées à la fois sur un stack en l'absence
d'échangeurs de chaleur et sur un stack couplé à des échangeurs. En l'absence d'échangeurs de
chaleur, le profil final de température moyenne est linéaire, ce qui est en accord avec les théories
classiques de la thermoacoustique, tandis qu'il s'aplatit près des extrémités du stack après couplage avec des échangeurs. L'existence d'un échauffement parasite le long de l'axe du stack,
qui se superpose à l'effet thermoacoustique et qui tire son origine de la dissipation visqueuse,
a également été mis en évidence. D ' a u t r e part, le fait de diminuer la conduction thermique
longitudinale dans le stack n'entraîne pas une augmentation de la différence de t e m p é r a t u r e
entre ses faces aussi i m p o r t a n t e que le prévoit la théorie de W h e a t l e y et coll. (1983). Enfin, sur
u n stack constitué d ' u n matériau poreux, couplé à des échangeurs de chaleur, le profil axial de
t e m p é r a t u r e moyenne n'est plus du tout linéaire : il s'arrondit et la t e m p é r a t u r e est plus élevée
au cœur du stack que sur sa face chaude.
P a r ailleurs, grâce à la technique de vélocimétrie par images de particules, nous avons étudié
l'évolution temporelle du champ de vitesse acoustique autour d'un stack thermoacoustique, ainsi
que dans ses canaux. E n particulier, nous avons réalisé des mesures dans un canal plan de 1.0 m m
de hauteur ainsi que dans un canal carré de 0.92 m m de côté. Les profils de vitesse obtenus
confirment la validité des modélisations linéaires de la propagation d'une onde acoustique dans
des canaux très fins où la viscosité de l'air a une influence. D ' a u t r e part, nous avons mis
en évidence l'existence de zones tourbillonnaires au voisinage des extrémités des plaques d'un
empilement, ce qui confirme les observations expérimentales de Wetzel et H e r m a n (2000) par
interférométrie holographique ainsi que les résultats des simulations numériques de Worlikar et
Knio (1996).},

In this work, we report a novel travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine, which incorporates phase change of a condensable component into the classical thermoacoustic conversion, and thus can work efficiently at a low-temperature difference ({\textless} 50 K). A numerical model was experimentally validated, based on which a thorough analysis of the engine’s onset and steady state under different working conditions was performed. It was found that the presence of phase change can significantly enhance thermoacoustic conversion, leading to increased efficiency and energy density. The presented engine exhibits a thermal-to-acoustic efficiency {\textgreater} 40\% of the Carnot efficiency when working at a temperature difference {\textless} 50 K. Moreover, the addition of phase change reduces the required mean pressure in the thermoacoustic engine by at least one order of magnitude, which is significant in terms of increasing safety and reducing cost of practical devices.},

Herein, we present a theoretical investigation on phase-change thermoacoustic heat pumping employing both an ideal model (a short heat pump in a pure travelling-wave field), as well as a full-size, looped-tube thermoacoustic heat pump. In the analysis of the short heat pump, we identified and assessed the main factors and their influence on the performance of an ideal phase-change travelling-wave heat pump. The results show that, ideally, the cooling power can be significantly increased by up to one order of magnitude, and the {COP} (coefficient of performance) can also be improved by the incorporation of phase change into the thermoacoustic cycle. Meanwhile, the analysis of the full system provides a more practical view of the enhancement due to phase change. A significant increase of cooling power is observed in the phase-change system with a high concentration of the reactive component, but increased of the {COP} only occurs under small temperature differences (below 10 K). The main reason for the gap in observed performance between the ideal model and the full system is the deviation, under a large temperature difference, of the acoustic field from the requirements for effective enhancement, as revealed in the ideal model. Our results demonstrate the potential of the phase-change travelling-wave thermoacoustic heat pump for efficient and low-cost heat pumping, especially for small temperature difference applications.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic refrigerators use acoustic power to transport heat from a low-temperature reservoir to a high-temperature reservoir through a stack in a resonance tube. These devices nowadays can be considered as an alternative cooling technology as they use environmentally friendly working fluids and have few moving components. This paper presents the design procedure of a small thermoacoustic refrigerator with nominal cooling power of 10 W. It explains the design choices with the reasons for using specific parameters. The design strategy applies simplified linear model of thermoacoustic in order to find optimum length and position of the stack. The model of the device was simulated by using a specialized tool {DELTAEC}. The simulation was performed under different temperatures of the cold heat exchanger varying from 250 to 295 K, and under different drive ratios varying from 0.006 to 0.016. The simulation results show that the cooling power of the refrigerator increases with the increase in the drive ratio and with the increase in the temperature of the cold heat exchanger. It was also found that the {EER} and the {EERC} coefficients of the device majorly depend on the temperature difference between the heat exchangers and only slightly depend on the drive ratio. The model achieved maximum cooling power of 55 W at the drive ratio of 0.016 and at the temperature difference between the heat exchangers of 5 K, which corresponded to {EER} of 2.03 and {EERC} of 0.034.},

Diﬀerent aspects of the constant property of the thermodynamic enthalpy in the stack are used by each approach: one maintains a constant value for the enthalpy while calculating the temperature and the other keeps the spatial derivative of the enthalpy equal to zero. The runtime and accuracy of the two approaches are compared by applying them to both a thermoacoustic refrigerator and engine model, and it is found that the second {methodÕs} introduction of an additional integration variable leads to more error than the ﬁrst {methodÕs} use of large numbers in the calculation.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic devices have drawn considerable attention of researchers due to their several advantages like simplicity of construction, maintenance free operation etc. It is known that the working gas for these systems should have lower prandtl number for their better performance. Gaseous mixtures are found to be more suitable due to their lower value of prandtl number compared to that for pure noble gases. A standing wave type half wavelength thermoacoustic engine is developed for 300 Hz resonating frequency with helium as working gas. In the present work experimental investigations are carried out with a few gaseous mixtures of helium, nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide on a standing a wave type thermo acoustic prime engine. Acoustic amplifier is used for amplification of the pressure ratio generated. Parametric investigations are carried out in terms of charging pressure and heat input temperature. Performance of the engine with these gaseous mixtures is reported.},

	abstract = {The classical linear thermoacoustic theory is integrated through a numerical calculus with a simple energy conservation model to allow estimates of the optimal length of thermoacoustic heat exchangers and of the magnitude of the related heat transfer coeﬃcients between gas and solid walls. This information results from the analysis of the temperature and heat ﬂux density distributions inside a thermally isolated thermoacoustic stack. The eﬀects of acoustic amplitude, plate spacing, plate thickness and Reynolds number on the heat transfer characteristics are examined. The results indicate that a net heat exchange between the acoustically oscillating gas and the solid boundary takes place only within a limited distance from the stack edges. This distance is found to be an increasing function of the plate spacing in the range (0 6 y0/dj 6 2), becoming constant for y0/dj P 2. The calculated dimensionless convective heat transfer coeﬃcients, the Nusselt numbers, between gas and solid wall are comparable to those evaluated from classical correlations for steady laminar ﬂow revised under the ‘‘Time-Average Steady-Flow Equivalent’’ ({TASFE}) and ‘‘root-mean-square Reynolds number’’ ({RMSRe}) models. Numerical results agree with measurements of the heat transfer coeﬃcient found in literature to within 20\%.},

A thermoacoustic engine (refrigerator) consists of a regenerator, a hot (cold) heat exchanger, two ambient heat exchangers, and a thermal buffer tube. The cross-sectional area of the engine is lower than the resonator cross-sectional area, so a holder is employed to fix the engine inside the resonator tube. The hemispherical end caps, the inner ducts, and the outer ducts have variable cross-sectional areas designed to create a converging-diverging path for the acoustic wave from the outer space to the inner space of the coaxial ducts. Progressive companies on the lookout for a reliable, maintenance-free, environmentally-friendly cooling technology driven by any heat source are the potential customers of this scalable invention.},

	abstract = {This paper puts forward a transient numerical model for thermoacoustic energy convertors using Rott’s equations combined with electrical circuit analogy. To enhance the accuracy of model outcomes, the lumped element values are updated at each time step as a function of temperature. Accordingly, a nonlinear temperature distribution is obtained along the hot core. The developed numerical approach is in line with the experimental results of a standing wave thermoacoustic engine. Based on this method, the temperature variations along the stack and the impact of stack material on start-up time and onset temperature are numerically investigated. Additionally, the onset temperature profiles are calculated and presented comparatively for the numerical and experimental results. The start-up time of spontaneous oscillations is calculated for the standing wave system. Consequently, the best geometry that quickly reaches sustained oscillations can be selected using this model. Examining the temperature profile during the start-up and damping process highlights a temperature difference between these two processes. This is calculated as 35 K in the numerical solution and measured as 38 K in the experiment for a standing wave engine. Observations show that using a material with lower thermal conductivity in the stack section can reduce the onset-damping temperature difference. The novel approach described here shows potential in capturing the onset-damping behavior of thermoacoustic systems efficiently.},

A closed loop may be formed by a displacer seal in a stirling cooler, which connects the compression and expansion spaces in parallel with the regenerator, or by a bypass orifice in a double-inlet pulse-tube cooler, which connects the warm end of the compliance tube (pulse tube) back to the compression space.
%{DC} gas flows were discovered in simulation models of double-inlet pulse-tube cryocoolers
%run with the Sage computer program. At the root of the problem are in-phase density
%velocity fluctuations in the flow-resistive elements of the closed loop which tend to
%product {DC} pressure gradients. The issue is whether or not these {DC} pressure gradients
%completely cancel each other. If they do not, then {DC} flow is the consequence and designers
%must contend with new thermal losses associated with components like regenerators and
%compliance tubes. A {DC} flow of less than one percent of the {AC} flow amplitude may be

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic heat pumps ({TAHPs}) can be used for heating and/or cooling purposes. Current designs of travelling-wave {TAHPs} normally employ a single acoustic driver and rely on a looped pipe to establish and maintain the required acoustic field. The resultant system is thereby bulky and expensive, detracting from the structure simplicity and low-cost advantages of thermoacoustic technology. To address this issue, this paper investigates the dual-acoustic-driver concept that can significantly increase the system’s compactness. Theoretical analyses are conducted for the dual-acoustic-driver {TAHP}, and the acoustic and temperature fields in the thermoacoustic core are examined. Parametric studies are undertaken to investigate the effects of acoustic drivers on the acoustic and thermal characteristics of the {TAHP}. It is found that, as the frequency of acoustic drivers changes, the acoustic field in the thermoacoustic ({TA}) core could be dominated by a standing, traveling, or hybrid standing-traveling wave. The temperature distribution within the {TA} core and temperature difference between the core ends will change accordingly. Results show that the temperature difference is non-zero only when the acoustic field contains a traveling-wave component. To obtain a large temperature difference, the acoustic drivers should be driven near resonance frequencies at which the acoustic field is hybrid and the pressure amplitude is large. This study gains new insights into the working mechanisms behind the dual-acoustic-driver {TAHP} concept, paving the way for developing compact, efficient, and high-power-density {TAHPs} for industrial waste heat recovery.},

	abstract = {The linear theory used to calculate the thermal quantities inside the stack in the classical thermoacoustic refrigerators always overestimates those measured. The causes of these discrepancies have to be found in the complex processes of thermal exchanges. The analytical study of the transient response should provide an interpretation of these complex processes. This present paper provides such analytical modelling. This modelling remains within the framework of the classical linear theory. It includes the effects of the thermoacoustic heat ﬂux carried along the stack, the conductive heat ﬂux returning in the solid walls of the stack and through the ﬂuid inside the stack, the transverse heat conduction in the stack and the heat leakages through the duct walls, the heat generated by viscous losses in the stack, the heat generated by vorticity at the ends of the stack, and the heat transfer through both ends of the stack. A modal analytical solution for the temperature proﬁle is proposed, assuming the usual approximations in such thermal problems to avoid intricate calculations and expressions. The theoretical transient response of a thermoacoustic refrigerator is compared with experimental data. A good qualitative agreement is obtained between analytical and experimental results after ﬁtting empirical coefﬁcients.},

L'effet thermoacoustique étant difficile à calculer de manière complète par une voie analytique, un code de calcul a été mis en place pendant cette thèse. Il a permis en particulier de s'intéresser à des problèmes tels que l'apparition de non-linéarités de température ou le calcul de flux thermique à des échangeurs de chaleur dans un écoulement oscillant. Ce faisant, les limites de la théorie linéaire classiquement utilisée pour décrire l'effet thermoacoustique ont été montrées et de premièrs résultats quant à l'optimisation du réfrigérateur thermoacoustique ont été donnés.},

The provision of heat to a thermoacoustic prime mover results in the generation of an acoustic wave that can be converted into electrical power. Thermoacoustic devices offer highly reliable and transportable power generation with low environmental impact using a variety of fuel sources. This paper focuses on the design and testing of a single stage, traveling wave, thermoacoustic engine. The system configuration, component design, and integration of sensors will be described. Performance testing and system analysis shows that for a 300 W heat source, the thermoacoustic machine generates a 54 Hz acoustic wave with a thermal efficiency of 7.8\%. The system's acoustic power output may be increased by 84\% through improved heat exchanger design. Tuning of the acoustic system and optimization of the bi-directional turbine merit attention to realize an applicable waste heat energy harvesting system.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115431},
	abstract = {A hybrid approach for thermoacoustic stability analysis is formulated in a state-space framework. The approach distinguishes between regions of the computational domain with and without important interactions between acoustics and mean flow or unsteady heat release, respectively. The former regions are modeled by a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method ({DG}-{FEM}) for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations in conservative form. The latter are represented by reduced-order models of acoustic wave propagation or dissipation, and provide complex-valued, frequency dependent impedance boundary conditions for the {DG}-{FEM} domain. The flow-flame coupling is modeled by a flame transfer function that governs a volumetric source term for the fluctuating heat release rate.
The respective (sub-)models are formulated and interconnected in a state-space framework, which facilitates the monolithic formulation of hybrid thermoacoustic models. Moreover, the state-space interconnect framework makes it possible to formulate thermoacoustic stability analysis as a linear eigenvalue problem – even if flame transfer function or acoustic boundary conditions depend in a non-trivial manner on frequency.
The approach is first verified against analytical solutions for a duct with mean flow across a thin heat source, similar to a Rijke tube. Then the thermoacoustic eigenmodes of a premixed, swirl-stabilized combustor are computed in order to validate the method against experimental data for a configuration of applied interest. For this second validation case, a detailed comparison against predictions of a low-order network-model is also presented.},

	abstract = {New experiments with a gas-filled resonance tube have shown that not only heating, but also cooling of the tube wall is possible and that these phenomena are not restricted to oscillation amplitudes that generate shocks. The present paper concentrates on amplitudes outside the shock region. For this case, an extended acoustic theory is worked out. The results show cooling in the section of the tube with maximum velocity amplitude (and thus dissipation) and marked heating in the region of the velocity nodes. A strong dependence of these effects on the Prandtl number is noted. The results are in good agreement with experiments. Although the theory is not valid for proper resonance conditions, it nevertheless sheds some light on what happens when nonlinear effects dominate.
            Closely related to the limit of validity of the thermoacoustic theory is the question of transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the viscous boundary layer (Stokes layer). This problem has also been investigated; the results are given in a separate paper (Merkli \& Thomann 1975). In the present article laminar flow is assumed.},

However, a practical classification offers itself since the creation of the theory of thermoacoustics in this general sense by Kirchhoff in 1868. The two important results deduced by Kirchhoff from his theory were corrections to the theory of friction; one result corrected Stokes' formula for the sound attenuation of plane waves in an unlimited medium, the second gave a modified result of the Helmholtz–Rayleigh theory of the attenuation in a duct. This chapter discusses thermoacoustic effects caused by heated surfaces, with particular emphasis on situations in which large amplitude acoustic oscillations are maintained. These are caused, as known, by configurations that are unstable. This chapter discusses oscillating flow over a nonisothermal surface. Damping and excitation of a gas column with temperature stratification is discussed. The chapter also elaborates about thermoacoustic streaming in detail.},

In addition, a carefully designed cold heat exchanger acts as a phase shifting inertance to improve the performance. A simple model has been developed to capture and demonstrate the physics of this new concept, while the whole system has been investigated in detail numerically by using a specialized design tool {DeltaEC}. Based on the current concept, a prototype has been designed, constructed and tested. It uses atmospheric air as the working fluid, a commercially available audio loudspeaker as the electro-dynamic transducer, and inexpensive standard parts as the acoustic resonator. The experimental results have verified the simplified model and the numerical simulations of the practical build. The small-scale inexpensive prototype generator produced 11.6W of electrical power, which shows the potential for developing cheap thermoacoustic electricity generators for energy recovery from waste heat sources. It is concluded that such concept could be very attractive provided that inexpensive ultra-compliant alternators based on the standard technology used in audio loudspeakers could be developed. Finally, some guidelines have been discussed and proposed for developing such alternators.},

L'objet de ce travail est d'entrer dans l'intelligence de ces problèmes, d'en traiter certains aspects sur la base de modèles analytiques et d'orienter les études expérimentales vers la conception et la réalisation de maquettes. Un premier aspect concerne le système couplé source-sonore/resonateur-thermoacoustique pour le réfrigerateur à onde stationnaire. L'objectif est d'aider au choix des paramètres de ce système qui optimisent l'efficacité pour le transfert de chaleur de la source froide à la source chaude. Une modélisation du système couplé, mise en place et validée par un ensemble de résultats expérimentaux, est utilisée pour déterminer la succession d'étapes suivies dans la réalisation d'une maquette. Des expériences de mesure de vitesses particulaires par anémometrie laser-doppler sont effectuées sur cette maquette. Couplées a celle de la pression acoustique ce type de mesure permet d'accéder à une mesure de la puissance acoustique en résonateur thermoacoustique. L'étude de certains phénomènes non-linéaires en résonateur thermoacoustique est ensuite abordée. Deux modèles analytiques sont présentés, dans lesquels la description des effets non-linéaires dans les machines thermoacoustiques permet une meilleure compréhension des phénomènes physiques les régissant. Le premier aboutit à une méthode active de suppression d'harmoniques crées par les non-linéarités qui utilise les caractéristiques du signal appliqué à la source sonore dans un réfrigerateur thermoacoustique. Le second permet de décrire la génération, l'amplification et la saturation en amplitude de l'onde acoustique dans un moteur thermoacoustique.},

Moreover, an analytical expression of spectra of the swept-sine signal is derived and used in the deconvolution of the impulse response. A Matlab code for generation of the synchronized swept-sine, deconvolution, and separation of the impulse responses is given with discussion of some application issues and an illustrative example of harmonic analysis of current distortion of a woofer is provided.},

The paper aims at characterizing the mechanical behaviour of electrodynamic loudspeaker suspensions at low frequencies using nonlinear identiﬁcation techniques developed in recent years. A Generalized Hammerstein based model can take into account both frequency dependency and nonlinear properties. As shown in the paper, the model generalizes existing nonlinear or viscoelastic models commonly used for loudspeaker modelling. It is further experimentally shown that a possible input-dependent law may play a key role in suspension characterization.},

	url = {https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE06-0007},
	abstract = {The goal of the project {TACOT} is to demonstrate the applicability of thermoacoustics for refrigeration in the automotive field. It brings together Groupe {PSA} and four {CNRS} research laboratories (Institut P’, {LAUM}, {LIMSI}, {LMFA}), and is organized into three challenges. The first challenge consists in designing, manufacturing and assessing the performance of a compact thermoacoustic device with one thermoacoustic core. The originality of the device comes from the use of two acoustic sources that yields its compactness. The device will be designed using available simulation tools that are based on the linear uni-dimensional theory of thermoacoustics and that can predict a steady state behavior of the device for one set of entry conditions. Due to the limiting hypotheses of these tools, it is expected that the performance of the prototype will be lower than the ones calculated by the model. It is therefore necessary to limit this discrepancy by assessing the performance of the device in order to better quantify the complexity of flow movement and heat transfer encountered in such a compact device. Simultaneous fundamental studies are proposed in a second challenge to improve the understanding and description of the phenomena that limit the efficiency of the device. Both experimental and numerical studies will be led to investigate about
- acoustical characteristics of thermoacoustic core (regenerator plus heat exchangers) of complex shape, especially at high acoustic levels and with temperature gradient,
- end effects and matching conditions between the different elements of the device: Source and cavity, regenerator and heat exchangers, heat exchangers and cavity ; these effects will be investigated experimentally both from a fluid dynamics and from a heat transfer point a view,
- phenomenological analysis and numerical simulation of complex flows that can appear as consequences of high amplitudes, complex geometries and thermoacoustic heat pumping in each element of the compact device. 
In the third challenge the evolution towards a performant compact dual thermoacoustic core heat-pump device will be investigated. The aim of this last challenge is to bring thermoacoustic compact devices to a competitive positioning as compared to in-use technologies. For this purpose, the results of challenges 1 and 2 will be used to propose an evolution of the thermoacoustic core towards higher performance. Also studies on a new architecture of acoustic source will be initiated. This new source architecture should allow to use two thermoacoustic cores, thus increasing the heat pumped from the cold source.  
These three challenges should lead to the proposal of a complete dual core refrigerator that could be a viable substitute for traditional air conditioning systems in the automotive industry both in terms of size and performance.},

This configuration is applicable to standing-wave thermoacoustic engines, usually composed of an acoustic resonator where a (short) stack (or porous medium) is inserted, with a heat exchanger placed at one of its ends. The resulting horizontal temperature gradient, when high enough, triggers the onset of an acoustic wave. Natural convection effects are usually neglected in thermoacoustics so that axisymmetry is often assumed. Here a 3D numerical study of natural convection flow is performed using a finite volume code for solving mixed Navier-Stokes and Darcy-Brinkman equations under Boussinesq approximation. The influence of the porous medium’s physical characteristics (permeability, thermal conductivity, anisotropy) on the flow and temperature fields is investigated. It is shown that such flows are fully three-dimensional and therefore can modify significantly starting as well as steady operating conditions of the thermoacoustic engine.},

It appears to be suitable for ﬁtting adjustable parameters to achieve optimal heat transfer or temperature gradient, even {COP}. This model has been used to design such thermoacoustic refrigerators, which involve compactness and ﬂexibility. The predicted characteristics are compared with some experimental results in this paper. Then performance of this small scale thermoacoustic device is compared with the one obtained with standing or travelling wave devices having similar stack/regenerator. Slightly higher eﬃciency than in the standing wave system is found, whereas the comparison with the coaxial travelling wave conﬁguration gives slightly lower eﬃciency, yet at much smaller size.},

The design for a small scale thermoacoustic refrigerator is presented in this paper. Two loudspeakers, set at the opposite ends of a small cavity and fully enclosed within the device, create an appropriate acoustic ﬁeld inside a stack ﬁlling this cavity. A push-pull concept with two cavities placed on either side of one of the loudspeakers could be considered. An analytical approach describing the pressure and velocity ﬁelds which can be obtained from these sources is provided, assuming that the wavelength is much greater than the dimensions of the cavity. This new thermoacoustic device simultaneously provides compactness and ﬂexibility compared to the classical standing wave or traveling wave devices which would achieve equivalent performances.},

However, until now, little has been reported on the influence of natural convection on the operation of the thermoacoustic engine. In this paper, the influence of natural convection is examined by running a series of experiments using different orientations with respect to gravity. It is found that with changing orientation, natural convection can cause a variation of the onset temperature where thermal oscillation begins. In addition, the temperature distribution in the regenerator and other important parameters are also affected. In general, adverse natural convection worsened the performance of the system, and in one case even caused the thermoacoustic engine to stop work.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic technology can play a significant role in the development of renewable energies. Thermoa­ coustic engines and heat pumps (or refrigerators) are however characterized by a low efficiency attributed to suboptimal components. The core of these devices is a porous material, named stack (or regenerator), in which thermoacoustic conversion takes place. The most frequently used stack in the literature remains the wire mesh, although there is still a lack of formulation for the corresponding thermoviscous response functions. Essentially, all the dynamic thermal and viscous behaviors of a porous structure can be derived thanks to the {JohnsonChampoux}-Allard-Lafarge ({JCAL}) semi-phenomenological model, where transport parameters provide input in­ formation on the macroscopic level to the model. Here, we report a set of structure–property correlations be­ tween the transport parameters of the stack and the geometrical features of the wire mesh obtained from firstprinciples calculations. Validation of the model is carried out by means of experimental measurements performed on three different specimens. Our results show that the knowledge of the termoviscous functions for the wire mesh allows drawing preliminary considerations on the thermoacoustic efficiency of the stack, without needing to consider a full numerical simulation of the entire device.},

	abstract = {The effect of natural convection on the oscillatory ﬂow in an open-ended pipe driven by a timewise sinusoidally varying pressure at one end and subjected to an ambient-to-cryogenic temperature difference across the ends, is numerically studied. Conjugate effects arising out of the interaction of oscillatory ﬂow with heat conduction in the pipe wall are taken into account by considering a ﬁnite thickness wall with an insulated exterior surface. Two cases, namely, one with natural convection acting downwards and the other, with natural convection acting upwards, are considered. The full set of compressible ﬂow equations with axissymmetry are solved using a pressure correction algorithm. Parametric studies are conducted with frequencies in the range 5–15 Hz for an end-to-end temperature difference of 200 and 50 K. Results are obtained for the variation of velocity, temperature, Nusselt number and the phase relationship between mass ﬂow rate and temperature. It is found that the Rayleigh number has a minimal effect on the time averaged Nusselt number and phase angle. However, it does inﬂuence the local variation of velocity and Nusselt number over one cycle. The natural convection and pressure amplitude have inﬂuence on the energy ﬂow through the gas and solid.},

The method proposed in this paper is based on a straightforward idea that permits ﬁrst to estimate the force factor without any model assumption and then to separate the electrical and mechanical impedance intuitively. Consequently, both impedances can be studied separately to highlight the importance of using models incorporating eddy currents on the electrical side and creep effect on the mechanical side.

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of thermoacoustic heat pumping along a stack of solid plates placed inside a compact cavity submitted to an oscillating ﬂow. Velocity and pressure ﬁelds are controlled by two acoustic sources: a main “pressure” source monitoring the ﬂuid compression and expansion phases, and a secondary “velocity” source generating the oscillating ﬂuid motion. Numerical simulations are performed with an “in-house” code solving Navier–Stokes equations under a Low Mach number approximation in a two-dimensional geometry. In the linear regime, thermoacoustic heat pumping is correctly described with this model for different sets of parameters such as thermo-physical properties of the stack plates, amplitude of pressure oscillation or of the velocity source, phase shift between both sources. Numerical results on the normalized temperature difference established between the ends of stack plates are in excellent agreement with analytical estimates and experimental results published in the literature. Several conﬁgurations corresponding to different thermal conditions applied on the outside wall and an inside separation plate are then considered. If the separation plate is adiabatic, temperature varies linearly along the stack, recovering classical linear theory’s results. If the separation plate is thermally conductive, the model, providing detailed description of local heat and mass transfer, shows that the temperature ﬁeld becomes fully two-dimensional and thermoacoustic heat pumping is less efﬁcient. The model is well adapted to explore the inﬂuence of local heat transfer constraints on the heat pump efﬁciency and thus well suited for detailed analyses of more complex mechanisms such as buoyancy effects.},

	abstract = {This manuscript deals with the experimental characterization of the acoustic limit cycle reached by self-sustained oscillations generated in thermoacoustic engines. A specially designed, high amplitude, acoustic impedance sensor was developed to perform measurements of the input impedance of a thermoacoustic core, as a function of the heating power supplied to the device, of the frequency, and of the amplitude of acoustic forcing. Those measurements can then be used to predict the spontaneous generation of acoustic oscillations and their saturation up to a certain steady-state. Those predictions were successful for various acoustic loads connected to the thermoacoustic core. Moreover, the measurements of acoustic impedance as a function of the amplitude of acoustic oscillations are compared to a model based on the linear thermoacoustic theory, and this comparaison provides insights into the processes controlling the saturation of acoustic oscillations. The experimental procedure described in this manuscript also leads to a pratical way of optimizing the coupling between the thermoacoustic core and the load, in the way that the potential eﬃciency of thermoacoustic energy conversion is maximized. Finally, an experimental method is described and allows to study the stability of limit cycles, i.e. the temporal evolution of the self-oscillation amplitude, in the case of a system that is able to give rise to a spontaneous periodic trigg and stop behavior.},
